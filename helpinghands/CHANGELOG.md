# Changelog

What each Mochi release changes, one sentence each.

## Unreleased

- RUSH Lab installs once per computer account and connects each member separately, so several accounts can be connected from one laptop at once.
- The site opens only once RUSH Lab on your computer is connected, Settings → Connection shows whether it is, and `npm start`'s site installs RUSH Lab built from the checkout, beside rush-lab.org's, with keys from its own $10 OpenRouter workspace.
- Plugins are now installed by each user for themselves, and `npm start` runs on a local copy of production's database that `npm run db:pull` refreshes and `npm run db:push -- <slug>` sends one workspace of back.
