## Railway service

The repository includes a production container and private Railway service
configuration for Mochi Lab.

Required variables:

```dotenv
PORT=8787
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
NANOAGENT_API_TOKEN=...
```

Deploy the service without a public domain. Mochi connects over Railway's
private network using the same `NANOAGENT_API_TOKEN`.

Local development does not use this deployment unless `NANOAGENT_URL` is
explicitly set. Mochi's `npm start` uses the adjacent NanoAgent checkout.
